## About job offers
Even though I have to admit that I'm a bit honored by all the job offerings lately, I now feel I need to publically announce that I already have a rather well payed day-job, and this is a hobby project. I am not currently looking for other opportunities.

Thanks for understanding,    
Niclas

## Can I test this before I download it?
Yes, you can. We have just setup a public demo server, this server is always up2date.<br>
IP: **94.23.50.5**    
Port: **19132**    
*This server will be automatically restarted when the CPU load is above 50% for security reasons.<br>

## What is this?

A basic Minecraft Pocket Edition (MCPE) server written in C#. Current goal is to create a server that has enterprise performance for large Minecraft multi-user gaming providers. Current servers handle 10-100 users per instance, the aim with MiNET is to deal with thousands. Priority is also to create interfaces, and to some extend, ready-made implementations of the most basic enterprise game-management features (users, worlds, etc.). With all likelyhood, MiNET will emerge into a Microsoft Cloud ready product.

As part of the project, I also deliver an up-to-date [automatically generated MCPE Protocol Specification](/src/MiNET/MiNET/Net/MCPE%20Protocol%20Documentation.md). This is a synery of that large parts of the communication code being generated using XML and T4 templates.

## Why do this?

This is actually a pet-project - a true father-son project that I do together with my son Oliver 6 years old. He is driving the requirements for this, doing much of prioritization of the order of implementation. He is a great fan of online-MCPE gaming, but still too young to play the "real deal". He also lacks the patience and understanding of laggy under-performant servers, and the consequences of that. He is also not a big fan of the kill-style game-modes around, so a sub-project of this is for him to create new kidz-friendly game-modes that we can implement in MiNET. Oliver was the one originally responsible for creating the scope of our project.

And as he really likes to tell his mother these days "Mom, don't disturb daddy. He is working for me now!". 6 years old, but I think you get the picture. I know he does.

MiNET is running CI through the fantastic service of AppVeyor. Currently the build status of master is...

## Can I do my own plugins?

Yes you can! See the [Plugin documention in the wiki](https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET/wiki/Plugin-API-Documentation)

We try to post upload some example plugins <b><a href="https://github.com/MiNET-Plugins">HERE</a></b>. **Please note that the plugin system is work in progress and the example might be outdated.**

## Can I contribute?

Of course you can! We just need you to accept the following:

1. You will use the same coding style as the rest of the code.
2. You do not copy code from anyone or anywhere, unless you have their permissions.
3. We can always decide not to include your code, and we might make changes to it.

Also, make sure to join our Gitter chat for easy communication.

## How do i install with [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/)

To install MiNET, run the following command in the Package Manager Console

    PM> Install-Package MiNET

### [MiNET NuGet Page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MiNET/)

## How do I install this on Linux?

On Linux, compiling and using the server is relatively straightforward but there are a few things that can catch you out in the process.

### Compiling the server

The first step is to clone the repository. The repo uses submodules so it's easiest if you use the `--recursive` switch to download them all at once. 

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:NiclasOlofsson/MiNET.git

Once you've cloned the repository, you can use the `xbuild` tool to compile the code. You'll need a relatively recent version of Mono to be able to run the server (3.10.x) and you might find that your distribution's repositories (if you're relying on them) have a version that's too old. As a result, you may want to looking into downloading the latest stable Mono build from the [website](http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-lin). xbuild will want to be given the path to the solution file to work:

    cd MiNET; xbuild src/MiNET/MiNET.sln

#### Troubleshooting

You might have some issues with the tool downloading NuGet packages. You'll see an error like the one below if this is the case:

    WARNING: Error getting response stream (Write: The authentication or decryption has failed.): SendFailure

To fix this, follow the instructions in [this StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16589218).

### Running the server

Now that the code is compiled, you can run the MiNET.Service.exe file using Mono:

    cd src/MiNET/MiNET.Service/bin/Debug; mono MiNET.Service.exe

If everything went as expected, you should see the following output:

```
 INFO [NetService] - Starting MiNET
 INFO [iNetServer] - Initializing...
 INFO [iNetServer] - Loading settings...
 INFO [iNetServer] - Loading plugins...
 INFO [iNetServer] - Plugins loaded!
 INFO [iNetServer] - Server open for business...
MiNET runing. Press <enter> to stop service..
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you instead see an exception like the one in the stack trace below, you need to update your version of Mono.

```
System.NotImplementedException: The requested feature is not implemented.
